Hey Dani/the other gent(Supervisor?) whose name I don't recall, my bad:

This Magic keyboard you've sold me has NO BlueTeeth!: this will mean that it's going to use up my _only_ USB port! on my MBAir, which has a FULL USB port, and a HALF USB port, the reasons for which I haven't yet been able to divine; 

Quandary!: where do I plug my USB mouse into?

IIRC, you kinda assured me that _both_, the smaller _and_ the larger (with a numeric keypad ++) were BlueTeeth connectible!

Please answer this question: is _at least_ the smaller one BlueTeeth capable? <=> this would need for me to make _yet another_ trip down to ValleyFair, bringing up the number of visits to 5: while I do enjoy the scintillating conversations with you Geniuses - despite any remonstrances to the contrary - 
   o who's going to pay for my gas?
   o who's going to cover my hourly rate, @ $100.00 per hour (I could have stayed put at home and attended to my work)
  o and if answers to the above 2 questions are above your pay grade, how could I escalate such concerns of mine, to whom, and/or would you be able to do it?

And if this message sounds like an irate rant, you must, and immediately, expunge such thoughts - they have no bearing in reality.

Kewl, let me know, at your earliest possible convenience, when may I visit you folks again, at _my_ earliest possible convenience; do you folks work Sundays?

Cheers and Best Regards,
Shailen
