Hey Dani, et al:


[Got a hit with

(owing to a few {keyboard, mouse, mission-control} settings)

Well, what was happening was this: 

1. (as a Siri notification informed me): the keyserver was misbehaving 

2. after fixing those, I ran a test at a bash prompt, which gave me:
 [
      [08:16:47] (shailen) [] on shailensair
      @ ~:

=>  abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ 1234567890-=` ~!@#$%^&*()_+  {}|[]\ ;' :" ,./ <>? 

       [08:18:53] (shailen) [] on shailensair

]

3. Tested this out in the vi(m) editor, within a terminal thusly:

[

       1234567890-=`

       ~!@#$%^&*()_+

       abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz

       ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ

       []\ {}|


       ,./ <>?

]

4. Finally, used Chrome to write this email to you guys.



It WOIKS! yep, (even) werks.



kewl, then, solved, looks like; (hope) I don't need to bug you guys anymore 

     - though the reimbursement for {gas, time-spent} still poses an issue, for me, (probably) not to you folks - there may be other avenues of redressal, will investigate/research and the usual blah-b-b.



5. However, I'll still need to come in to (please let me know if your store's open tomorrow; no need, really, I'll look it up)

       return the 'Magic' KB, and get a refund of $129.99 (+ SCC tax, of course), 

        making that my 5th trip down south 

        (I live close to the Levi's stadium + the Great America fun and frolic place, 

        I seem to remember: wasn't someone trying to 'Make America Great Again'?, 

        seems kinda redundant; but then, I'll keep my peace); 

        needless to say (then, why am I saying it?, clueless, here), 

                  I'll really, really, really be more than happy to exchange scintillating palaver (again!) 

                       with y'all, just hoping that some of the 

                              'G' stuff may rub off on me, make me a better man, et c., et c.



Till then,

Pax et Dominus Vobiscum,



Cheers,

Shailen
